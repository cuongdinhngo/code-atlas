## 001 — Fold a mid-task governance request into the ticket's scope, don't ride it on the branch
When a user asks for a repo-wide rule change mid-task (here: the "Token usage on PR" rule in
`CLAUDE.md` + `docs/BACKLOG.md`), the ticket-blind challenger and the reviewer both read it as
untraceable scope creep — it maps to no ticket requirement. **Fix:** add it to the task's
Scope/Deliverables + a matrix row (task 001 → R6 + change-list item 8) with a one-line rationale, so
every hunk still traces to a requirement. Splitting it into its own docs ticket is the alternative;
either way, never let a change ride the branch untraceable to a row.
