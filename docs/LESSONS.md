# Lessons — code-atlas

Durable lessons discovered while shipping tasks: constraints found, wrong assumptions, process gaps.
One entry per lesson; newest first.

## 003 — The R1.1 grep-gate fires on ordinary English, not just on code
The CI guardrail for "no language branches in the core" is
`grep -rEn 'if[^\n]*\blanguage\b[^\n]*==|match[^\n]*\blanguage\b' code_atlas/`
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml:49`). Its second alternative has **no code anchor**: any line under
`code_atlas/` where the token `match` appears *before* the word `language` fails the build — including
a plain comment or docstring like `# match the language name to its env var`. The reverse order
(`language … match`) is safe. **Fix:** when touching the core, phrase prose so `language` precedes
`match` (or avoid one word), and run the gate's exact regex locally before opening the PR — a green
`pytest`/`ruff`/`mypy` says nothing about it. Generalises: a guardrail expressed as a text grep over
source will also match the *prose* in that source, so treat comments and docstrings as inputs to
every grep-gate, not just the code.

## 002 — A guard written before its consumers exist must be negative-controlled
Task 002's AC2(b) ("no field lists duplicated in store/indexer") was **vacuously true**: all five
schema-consuming modules were one-line stubs, so any grep or guard passed while proving nothing about
the tasks that would actually write them. A guard that cannot fail is not evidence. **Fix:** inject a
real violation (`COLUMNS = ["kind", "name", …]` appended to `store.py`), confirm the guard fails, then
remove it and confirm the file is byte-identical again — and assert the guard's own inputs are non-empty
(`len(VOCABULARY) == 38`, `len(consumers()) >= 5`) so it can't silently degrade to a no-op later.
Generalises: when an acceptance criterion is satisfied only because the thing it constrains doesn't
exist yet, say so out loud and either negative-control the guard or record the vacuity.

## 001 — Fold a mid-task governance request into the ticket's scope, don't ride it on the branch
When a user asks for a repo-wide rule change mid-task (here: the "Token usage on PR" rule in
`CLAUDE.md` + `docs/BACKLOG.md`), the ticket-blind challenger and the reviewer both read it as
untraceable scope creep — it maps to no ticket requirement. **Fix:** add it to the task's
Scope/Deliverables + a matrix row (task 001 → R6 + change-list item 8) with a one-line rationale, so
every hunk still traces to a requirement. Splitting it into its own docs ticket is the alternative;
either way, never let a change ride the branch untraceable to a row.
